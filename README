A simple vim plugin that aligns text separated with tabs or two or more whitespaces, so that each part starts in the same column as in the other lines. Just like a table, but without lines.
Before:
part one        part two     part three
 another part one              another part two    another part three

After:
part one                  part two                 part three
another part one    another part two   another part three

(would be more observable with monospace typeÂ…)


Usage: to align the whole buffer, type :Tabbi, for aligning parts type e.g. :10,20Tabbi or use visual mode.
