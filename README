A simple vim plugin that aligns text separated with tabs or two or more whitespaces, so that each part starts in the same column as in the other lines. Similar as a table, but without lines.

Before:
part one        part two     part three
 another part one              another part two    another part three

After:
part one                  part two                 part three
another part one    another part two   another part three

Usage: to align the whole buffer, type :Tabbi, for aligning parts type e.g. :10,20Tabbi or use visual mode.



With the function Tabb(<pattern> [<trim> [,<separator]]) it is possible to format the selected lines.
<pattern> is the pattern after which the lines should be formatted, §x or §x-y is replaced by the corresponding column. §- can be used to align the lines like the :Tabbi command.
<trim> is a boolean specifying if the parts are trimmed (default 0).
<sep> is a string or regular expression that specifies the string separating the line into columns. The default is tabs or two or more whitespaces.
See the plugin file for more details.

Before:
part one, part two  ,part three , part four, rest
one  , two , three

-> select the lines and type :call Tabb("§2: §1§-§3-4", 1, ",")

Result:
part two: part one  - part three , part four
two: one                  - three
